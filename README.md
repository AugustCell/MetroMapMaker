# MetroMapMaker
CSE219 final project. This was a large scale GUI which allowed the user to make a metro map.

This metro map contained creation of stations, creation of lines between stations, free movement of stations, photo additions, text labels, etc.

This was built off a framework developed by our professor. 

Project was made using Java/JavaFX/XML/JSON data.
